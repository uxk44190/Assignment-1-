# Linear Regression: Closed-Form vs Gradient Descent

This project compares two ways to perform linear regression:

1. **Closed-Form Solution** — solves directly using matrix math.
2. **Gradient Descent** — finds the solution step-by-step.

We generate synthetic data (`y = 3 + 4x + noise`) and fit a line using both methods.

## What You’ll See

- A scatter plot of the data
- Two fitted lines (one per method)
- A loss curve showing gradient descent progress

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib
